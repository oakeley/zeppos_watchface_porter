# zeppos_watchface_porter
Automated script to port ARKRN gts4mini watchfaces to the Amazfit Falcon, GTR3-pro and GTR4
It takes the latest version of the code from <a href="https://github.com/4RK4N/zeppos_watchdrip_timer_wf">4RK4N</a> and transforms to make a Falcon version.

# Instructions:
type:
   mkdir folder
   
   cd folder
   
   git clone https://github.com/4RK4N/zeppos_watchdrip_timer_wf

If you have a Falcon watch type

bash fixwatchface.sh falcon

If you have a GTR3pro type

bash fixwatchface.sh gtr-3-pro

If you have a different watch that runs Zepp OS then contact me on Discord- My fee is that you send a photo of how it look on a real watch so that I know it works (because the emulator is meh)
